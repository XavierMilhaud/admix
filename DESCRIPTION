Description: This package implements several methods to estimate the
    unknown quantities related to two-component admixture models,
    depending on the assumptions made on the unknown component density. In
    practice, one can estimate both the mixture weight and the unknown
    component density in a wide variety of frameworks. On top of that,
    hypothesis tests can be performed in one and two-samples contexts to
    test the unknown component density. Finally, clustering of unknown
    mixture components is also feasible in a K-samples setting.
